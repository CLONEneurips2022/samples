### Prosody Predictor Transfer

By replacing the speaker id of the prosody predictor, we can use the prosody of different speaker to synthesize the sound of the same timbre.

| Speaker A | Speaker A with Prosody Predictor of Speaker B | Speaker B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| samples/1.wav | samples/1_trans.wav | samples/1_ori.wav |
| samples/2.wav | samples/2_trans.wav | samples/2_ori.wav |
| samples/3.wav | samples/3_trans.wav | samples/3_ori.wav |
